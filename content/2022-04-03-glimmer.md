## Backstory

After having some success installing Linux on a battery-less
[CR48 Chromebook](https://google.fandom.com/wiki/Cr-48) I
decided it was time to get something slightly faster, with a battery.
Eventually I found a [ThinkPad Yoga 11e](https://a.co/d/9KufB9v) on Amazon for
$60! So I ordered it and waited patiently for it to arrive. The day it showed
up I got to work flashing the firmware so I could install Linux on it.

I found an awesome
[tutorial](https://gist.github.com/amonks/c089600bae9419013f3f9e801154d4e2)
online and followed along closely. After entering _developer mode_, tearing the
whole laptop apart, and removing the _write-protect_ screw, I was ready to
flash the firmware. I reassembled the whole machine, booted it up, launched a
_crosh_ and then _bash_ shell, and ran the _MrChromebox.tech_
[firmware-util](https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript) script.

![fwutil example](/images/2022-04-03-glimmer/fwutil.png)

I hesitated at first, not being entirely sure which option to select. After a
quick Google search and a glance at the first result, I decided to select
option 1: **Install/Update RW_LEGACY Firmware**.

## Oops

The install went great, it had a nice progress read out and a success message
at the end! I felt completely confident that I had nailed it. But of course, I
did not. I installed the legacy BIOS option, but my laptop uses UEFI not BIOS
([learn more](https://www.easeus.com/partition-manager-software/uefi-vs-bios.html)).
This effectively bricked my machine. Immediately after rebooting I was met with
a horrifying black screen. I didn't even have the faint glow of the LCD back
light to comfort me. I tried, in vain, for about an hour to boot off a USB, get
into the BIOS, or even just get the LED in the ThinkPad logo to light up on the
back. With my efforts bearing no results, I eventually gave up. Distraught and
grieving over the $60 I had wasted in less than 2 hours, I walked away.

About a week later, still with the bitter taste of defeat, I decided to see if
I could fix it. After all, the hardware was fine, I had just written an
incompatible firmware to some flash storage chip on the motherboard somewhere.
So I set out searching for anyone who had gotten themselves into a similar
situation. One day I came across
[Flashing the BIOS to Fix a "Bricked" Lenovo Laptop](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/flashing-the-bios-to-fix-a-bricked-lenovo-laptop/)
by [Dave Madison](https://www.partsnotincluded.com/about/) offering a solution
to my exact problem. Suddenly there was a light at the end of the tunnel. A
potential solution that had an excellent chance of working. And I was ready to
redeem myself from this rookie mistake!

## Redemption

The first challenge I needed to overcome was finding and downloading the
correct firmware. After no results searching directly for the firmware, I
decided to go back to where it all started, the _firmware-util_ script. After a
quick look at the
[code](https://github.com/MrChromebox/scripts/blob/master/firmware-util.sh) on
GitHub I noticed that there was a huge list of firmware
[sources](https://github.com/MrChromebox/scripts/blob/master/sources.sh). A
quick search for the code name _glimmer_, and I found
[the firmware](https://github.com/MrChromebox/scripts/blob/24c242711d82c32443907f538d0fc3c715bca263/cbmodels.json#L83)
that I was supposed to have installed.

So with the correct firmware in hand, all that was left to do was flash it to
the laptop. In the _Parts Not Included_ article they used a $22
[Arduino Nano](https://a.co/d/7VlKlc5) with a $7
[Serial Converter](https://a.co/d/8pWP8gh) to connect to a $7
[SOIC8 Clip](https://a.co/d/cqpeg1p) which would then connect to the flash chip
on the motherboard. Then they compiled
[flashrom](https://www.flashrom.org/Flashrom) for their Arudino, and used that
to flash the correct firmware onto the chip. Paying $36 to rescue a $60 laptop
wasn't ideal, so I bought the $7 SOIC8 clip and about $7 worth of [jumper
cables](https://a.co/d/ekUqHcF) figuring I'd make due with a Raspberry Pi I had
laying around.

Turns out, running _flashrom_ on a Raspberry Pi is a common use case. So
common, in fact, that there is a whole
[wiki page](https://www.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi) for it. The pin-out on that
page, along with the corresponding pin-out for my Raspberry Pi, was enough for
me to come up with the following wiring to get the SOIC clip hooked up.

### Wiring Key

|Pin|ABBR|Purpose|Color|
|---|----|-------|-----|
| 1 |CS  | Chip Select | Orange |
| 2 |SO  | Serial Out | Yellow |
| 3 |WP# | Write Protection | Red |
| 4 |GND | Ground | Brown |
| 5 |SI  | Serial In | Green |
| 6 |CLK | Clock | Blue |
| 7 |HOLD| Hold | Purple |
| 8 |VCC |3.3V Power | Grey |

### Raspberry Pi

> I used a Pi 3B, but it seems most models have similar pin-outs.

| GPIO | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H | I | J | K | L | M | N | O | P | Q | R | S | T |
| - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Outer | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | 4 | . | 1 | . | . | . | . | . | . | . | . |

### SOIC Clip

> Any side can be top or bottom. You just need to know which side goes where

| SOIC Pins |A|B|C|D|
|-|-|-|-|-|
| Top |8|7|6|5|
| Bottom |1|2|3|4|

### End Result

After I got all of that hooked up I had something that looked like an alien
weapon, and I loved everything about it!

## Resurrection

With the proper firmware downloaded, and the SOIC clip wired up, the next thing
to do was take the laptop apart again. Lenovo has a pretty in-depth
[hardware manual](https://download.lenovo.com/ibmdl/pub/pc/pccbbs/mobiles_pdf/11e_chromebook_yoga_11e_chromebook_hmm_en_sp40a26992_01.pdf),
without which I would have had a much harder time figuring out what I was
looking for. After taking the entire lower half of the laptop apart I was able
to remove the motherboard. I tore off a black plastic sheet, that I hoped
wasn't too important, and located the flash chip where the BIOS is stored.

![MOBO with flash chip](/images/2022-04-03-glimmer/flash-chip.png)

After a few attempts I was able to clip the SOIC flasher onto the chip -- which
is surprisingly difficult to do correctly -- so then I just needed to flash the
new firmware!

I ended up writing a [series of scripts](https://github.com/macuyler/glimmer)
to handle the flashing using _flashrom_.

Test the serial connection:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Reference: https://www.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi

/usr/sbin/flashrom \
	-p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=1000
```

Backup the current firmware:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Reference: https://www.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi

CHIP="W25Q64.W"

/usr/sbin/flashrom \
	-p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=1000 \
	-c $CHIP \
	-r ./roms/backup.rom
```

Write the new firmware:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Reference: https://www.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi

CHIP="W25Q64.W"
ROM="./roms/coreboot_tiano-glimmer-mrchromebox_20210725.rom"

/usr/sbin/flashrom \
	-p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=1000 \
	-c $CHIP \
	-w $ROM
```

Verify that the firmware on the chip matches your local copy:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Reference: https://www.flashrom.org/RaspberryPi

CHIP="W25Q64.W"

/usr/sbin/flashrom \
	-p linux_spi:dev=/dev/spidev0.0,spispeed=1000 \
	-c $CHIP \
	-r ./roms/verify.rom
```

After a painstakingly slow flashing process, it was all done. I quickly put the
laptop back together and booted it up. Eureka!

## Conclusion

After un-bricking the laptop, I was able to install several Linux distributions
on it and it is still going strong to this day. I have been impressed by how
good the battery life is, because it is using such a low powered chip. Bricking
and then un-bricking this laptop was a great learning experience that I'm glad
I had. This was by far the most complicated and in-depth hardware hack I have
accomplished to date, and I hope it stays that way for the foreseeable future.

If you or a loved one are suffering from a bricked laptop, I hope this post has
been helpful and I wish you the best of luck on your road to recovery.
